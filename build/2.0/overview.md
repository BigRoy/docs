## How the documentation is organized

A high-level overview of how it's organized will help you know where to look for certain things:

- [Tutorials](tutorials/) take you by the hand through a series of steps to producing your first asset. Start here if you're new to Avalon or content creation.
- [Reference guides](reference/) contain technical reference for APIs and other aspects of Avalon's machinery. They describe how it works and how to use it but assume that you have a basic understanding of key concepts.
- [How-to guides](howto/) are recipes. They guide you through the steps involved in addressing key problems and use-cases. They are more advanced than tutorials and assume some knowledge of how Avalon works.
- [Topic guides](guides/) discuss key topics and concepts at a fairly high level and provide useful background information and explanation.
